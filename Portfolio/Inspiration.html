        <p class="text1">I never dealt with Web Development before, neither was I much invested into it. Nevertheless I always wanted to try my hands on Web Development but didn't know where to start and using this as an excuse I kept trying different stacks that were being taught in college.</p>

        <p class="text2">But one day <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/tanaypratap/"> Tanay Pratap </a> woke up and decided to start <a href = "https://2020.teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/"> #TeamTanayJobChallenge </a> and provided us with deadline, resources and assigned some tasks. It gave the push which was needed into the leap of Web Development.</p>

        <p class="text3">This personal portfolio website is also created after learning the basics from him. All I can say is that I am very gratefull to him. Thank you Sir!</p>

                    Motivation is overrated. It's the will which matters. Motivation means you wanting to do the right thing for you. Will means irrespective of what 'you want', you always do the right thing. - Tanay Pratap
